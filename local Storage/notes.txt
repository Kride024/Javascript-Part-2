 Sets and arrays are both structure in javaScript,but they have some
 key difference in terms of their characteristics and use cases:

 Uniqueness:
 Array: Can contain duplicate values.Elements are ordered and can be 
 accessed by their index.
 Set: Contains only unique values.No duplicates are allowed.
 The order of Elements is not guaranteed.

 Order:
 Array: Elements are ordered and have a specific index.The order is based 
 on the order in which elements were added.
 Set:The order of elements is not guaranteed.Iterating over a set may
 not produce elements in the order they were added.

 Methods and properties:
 Array: Has a variety of methods for manipulation,like push, pop,splice,
 etc.It also has properties like length.
 Set:Has methods like add,delete , and has.It does not have properties
 like length,and its size is determined using the size properties.

 Use Cases:
 Array:Typically used when order and duplicates values are important,and
 when you need to access elements by their index.
 Set:Useful when uniqueness is a priority,and the order of elements is 
 not crucial.Sets are often used for tasks line filtering out duplicates from 
 an array. 

 Iterating:
 Array:You can Iterate over elements using methods like forEach or a 
 simple for loop.
 Set:You can use the forEach method or use the iterable protocol with a
 for...of loop for iteration.
