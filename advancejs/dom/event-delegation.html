<!--* Event Propagation
 <!--*___________________________________________

 <!--? Event delegation is a concept in javascript where instead of attaching event listener to individual elements, you attach a single event listener to a common ancestor of those elements.This is particularly useful when you have a  large number of similar element and simplify code.-->
  <!-- Example -->
   <!--? consider you have list of 100 element and you have to fire same "click element to all" else than adding separate event listener to each element-->
